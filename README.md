# SwiftPHFComposeBarTest

This app demonstrates the use of the [PHFComposeBarView](https://github.com/fphilipe/PHFComposeBarView) control in a Swift iOS app.

This branch incorporates the control using the storyboard to work around an issue detailed in this [question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31246045/how-do-i-make-a-phfcomposebarview-control-become-active-in-a-swift-ios-app).

The app was built in Swift 2.0 using XCode 7.0 Beta 2.
